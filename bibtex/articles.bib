abstract = {Aplanatic telescopes with two aspheric mirrors, configured to correct spherical and coma aberrations, are considered for application in $\gamma$-ray astronomy utilizing the ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov technique. We explore the phase space of optical system parameters to find telescope configurations which minmize astigmatism. It is shown that unlike the traditional prime-focus Davies-Cotton design, such telescopes provide a solution for wide field of view $\gamma$-ray observations. The designs are isochronous, can be optimized to have no vignetting across the field, and allow for significant reduction of the plate scale, making them compatible with finely-pixilated cameras, which can be constructed from modern, cost-effective image sensors such as multi-anode PMTs, SiPMs, or image intensifiers. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The field of gamma-ray astronomy has seen important progress during the last decade, yet there exists so far no common software framework for the scientific analysis of gamma-ray telescope data. We propose to fill this gap by means of the GammaLib software, a generic library that we have developed to support the analysis of gamma-ray event data. GammaLib has been written in C++ and all functionality is available in Python through an extension module. On top of this framework we have developed the ctools software package, a suite of software tools that enables building of flexible workflows for the analysis of Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope event data. The ctools are inspired by science analysis software available for existing high-energy astronomy instruments, and they follow the modular ftools model developed by the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center. The ctools have been written in Python and C++, and can be either used from the command line, via shell scripts, or directly from Python. In this paper we present the GammaLib and ctools software versions 1.0 that have been released end of 2015. GammaLib and ctools are ready for the science analysis of Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope event data, and also support the analysis of Fermi-LAT data and the exploitation of the COMPTEL legacy data archive. We propose to use ctools as the Science Tools software for the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory.},

abstract = {The High Altitude Water Cherenkov observatory (HAWC) is an air shower array devised for TeV gamma-ray astronomy. HAWC is located at an altitude of 4100 m a.s.l. in Sierra Negra, Mexico. HAWC consists of 300 Water Cherenkov Detectors, each instrumented with 4 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). HAWC re-uses the Front-End Boards from the Milagro experiment to receive the PMT signals. These boards are used in combination with Time to Digital Converters (TDCs) to record the time and the amount of light in each PMT hit (light flash). A set of VME TDC modules (128 channels each) is operated in a continuous (dead time free) mode. The TDCs are read out via the VME bus by Single-Board Computers (SBCs), which in turn are connected to a gigabit Ethernet network. The complete system produces ≈500 MB/s of raw data. A high-throughput data processing system has been designed and built to enable real-time data analysis. The system relies on off-the-shelf hardware components, an open-source software technology for data transfers (ZeroMQ) and a custom software framework for data analysis (AERIE). Multiple trigger and reconstruction algorithms can be combined and run on blocks of data in a parallel fashion, producing a set of output data streams which can be analyzed in real time with minimal latency ({\textless}5 s). This paper provides an overview of the hardware set-up and an in-depth description of the software design, covering both the TDC data acquisition system and the real-time data processing system. The performance of these systems is also discussed.},

abstract = {Ground based gamma-ray observations with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) play a significant role in the discovery of very high energy (E {\textgreater} 100 GeV) gamma-ray emitters. The analysis of IACT data demands a highly efficient background rejection technique, as well as methods to accurately determine the energy of the recorded gamma-ray and the position of its source in the sky. We present results for background rejection and signal direction reconstruction from first studies of a novel data analysis scheme for IACT measurements. The new analysis is based on a set of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied to images from the four H.E.S.S. phase-I telescopes. As the H.E.S.S. cameras pixels are arranged in a hexagonal array, we demonstrate two ways to use such image data to train CNNs: by resampling the images to a square grid and by applying modified convolution kernels that conserve the hexagonal grid properties. The networks were trained on sets of Monte-Carlo simulated events and tested on both simulations and measured data from the H.E.S.S. array. A comparison between the CNN analysis to current state-of-the-art algorithms reveals a clear improvement in background rejection performance. When applied to H.E.S.S. observation data, the CNN direction reconstruction performs at a similar level as traditional methods. These results serve as a proof-of-concept for the application of CNNs to the analysis of events recorded by IACTs.},

abstract = {Ground based Cherenkov telescope systems measure astrophysical gamma-ray emission against a background of cosmic-ray induced air showers. The subtraction of this background is a major challenge for the extraction of spectra and morphology of gamma-ray sources. The unprecedented sensitivity of the new generation of ground based very-high-energy gamma-ray experiments such as H.E.S.S. has lead to the discovery of many previously unknown extended sources. The analysis of such sources requires a range of different background modelling techniques. Here we describe some of the techniques that have been applied to data from the H.E.S.S. instrument and compare their performance. Each background model is introduced and discussed in terms of suitability for image generation or spectral analysis and possible caveats are mentioned. We show that there is not a single multi-purpose model, different models are appropriate for different tasks. To keep systematic uncertainties under control it is important to apply several models to the same data set and compare the results.},

Array entered Phase II in September 2012 with the inauguration of a fifth telescope that is larger and more complex than the other four. This paper will give an overview of the current H.E.S.S. central data acquisition (DAQ) system with particular emphasis on the upgrades made to integrate the fifth telescope into the array. At first, the various requirements for the central DAQ are discussed then the general design principles employed to fulfil these requirements are described. Finally, the performance, stability and reliability of the H.E.S.S. central DAQ are presented. One of the major accomplishments is that less than 0.8{\%} of observation time has been lost due to central DAQ problems since 2009. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Design Patterns is a modern classic in the literature of object-oriented development, offering timeless and elegant solutions to common problems in software design. It describes patterns for managing object creation, composing objects into larger structures, and coordinating control flow between objects. The book provides numerous examples where using composition rather than inheritance can improve the reusability and flexibility of code. Note, though, that it's not a tutorial but a catalog that you can use to find an object-oriented design pattern that's appropriate for the needs of your particular application--a selection for virtuoso programmers who appreciate (or require) consistent, well-engineered object-oriented designs. Now on {\{}CD{\}}, this internationally acclaimed bestseller is more valuable than ever! Use the contents of the {\{}CD{\}} to create your own design documents and reusable components. The {\{}CD{\}} contains: 23 patterns you can cut and paste into your own design documents; sample code demonstrating pattern implementation; complete Design Patterns content in standard {\{}HTML{\}} format, with numerous hyperlinked cross-references; accessed through a standard web browser; Java-based dynamic search mechanism, enhancing online seach capabilities; graphical user environment, allowing ease of navigation. First published in 1995, this landmark work on object-oriented software design presents a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to common design problems. Created by four experienced designers, the 23 patterns contained herein have become an essential resource for anyone developing reusable object-oriented software. In response to reader demand, the complete text and pattern catalog are now available on {\{}CD{\}}-{\{}ROM{\}}. This electronic version of Design Patterns enables programmers to install the book directly onto a computer or network for use as an online reference for creating reusable object-oriented software. The authors first describe what patterns are and how they can help you in the design process. They then systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. All patterns are compiled from real-world examples and include code that demonstrates how they may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages such as C++ and Smalltalk. Readers who already own the book will want the {\{}CD{\}} to take advantage of its dynamic search mechanism and ready-to-install patterns.},

abstract = {We present a method of atmospheric Cherenkov imaging which reconstructs the unique arrival direction of TeV gamma rays using a single telescope. The method is derived empirically and utilizes several features of gamma-ray induced air showers which determine, to a precision of 0.12 degrees, the arrival direction of photons, on an event-by-event basis. Data from the Whipple Observatory's 10 m gamma-ray telescope is utilized to test selection methods based on source location. The results compare these selection methods with traditional techniques and three different camera fields of view. The method will be discussed in the context of a search for a gamma-ray signal from a point source located anywhere within the field of view and from regions of extended emission.},

abstract = {The Whipple Observatory 10-m reflector, operating as a 37-pixel camera, has been used to observe the Crab Nebula in TeV gamma rays. By selecting gamma-ray images based on their predicted properties, more than 98 percent of the background is rejected; a detection is reported at the 9.0-sigma level, corresponding to a flux of 1.8 x 10 to the -11th photons sq cm/s above 0.7 TeV (with a factor of 1.5 uncertainty in both flux and energy). Less than 25 percent of the observed flux is pulsed at the period of PSR 0531. There is no evidence for variability on time scales from months to years. Although continuum emission from the pulsar cannot be ruled out, it seems more likely that the observed flux comes from the hard Compton synchrotron spectrum of the nebula.},

@article{Vinogradov2012,
abstract = {Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM), also called Solid State Photomultipliers (SSPM), are based on Geiger mode avalanche breakdown that is limited by a strong negative feedback. An SSPM can detect and resolve single photons due to the high gain and ultra-low excess noise of avalanche multiplication in this mode. Crosstalk and afterpulsing processes associated with the high gain introduce specific excess noise and deteriorate the photon number resolution of the SSPM. The probabilistic features of these processes are widely studied because of its significance for the SSPM design, characterization, optimization and application, but the process modeling is mostly based on Monte Carlo simulations and numerical methods. In this study, crosstalk is considered to be a branching Poisson process, and analytical models of probability distribution and excess noise factor (ENF) of SSPM signals based on the Borel distribution as an advance on the geometric distribution models are presented and discussed. The models are found to be in a good agreement with the experimental probability distributions for dark counts and a few photon spectrums in a wide range of fired pixels number as well as with observed super-linear behavior of crosstalk ENF. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The steady TeV gamma-ray emission from the Crab Nebula has been used to optimize the sensitivity of the Whipple Observatory atmospheric Cerenkov imaging telescope. Using this method, which is of order 20 times more sensitive than the standard method using a simple non-imaging detector, it is possible to detect the Crab Nebula at a significance level in excess of 6 standard deviations (6 sigma) in under 1 hr on source (with a corresponding time observing a background comparison region); a source one-tenth the strength of the Crab Nebula can be detected at the 4 sigma level after 40 hr on the source (and 40 hr on a background region). A variety of sources have been monitored using this technique over the period 1988-1991, but none were detected apart from the Crab Nebula. Upper limits are presented which in many instances are a factor of 10 below the flux of the Crab Nebula. These upper limits assume steady emission from the source and cannot rule out sporadic gamma-ray emission with short duty cycles.},

@article{Zorn2017,
abstract = {The Compact High Energy Camera (CHEC) is a camera design for the Small-Sized Telescopes (SSTs; 4 m diameter mirror) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). The SSTs are focused on very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray detection via atmospheric Cherenkov light detection over a very large area. This implies many individual units and hence cost-effective implementation, as well as shower detection at large impact distance, and hence large field of view (FoV), and efficient image capture in the presence of large time gradients in the shower image detected by the camera. CHEC relies on dual-mirror optics to reduce the plate-scale and make use of 6 × 6 mm2pixels, leading to a low-cost (∼150 k€), compact (0.5 m × 0.5 m), and light (∼45 kg) camera with 2048 pixels providing a camera FoV of ∼9 degrees. The CHEC electronics are based on custom TARGET (TeV array readout with GSa/s sampling and event trigger) application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) sampling incoming signals at a gigasample per second, with flexible camera-level triggering within a single backplane FPGA. CHEC is designed to observe in the $\gamma$-ray energy range of 1–300 TeV, and at impact distances up to ∼500 m. To accommodate this and provide full flexibility for later data analysis, full waveforms with 96 samples for all 2048 pixels can be read out at rates up to ∼900 Hz. The first prototype, CHEC-M, based on multi-anode photomultipliers (MAPMs) as photosensors, was commissioned and characterised in the laboratory and during two measurement campaigns on a telescope structure at the Paris Observatory in Meudon. In this paper, the results and conclusions from the laboratory and on-site testing of CHEC-M are presented. They have provided essential input on the system design and on operational and data analysis procedures for a camera of this type. A second full-camera prototype based on Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), addressing the drawbacks of CHEC-M identified during the first prototype phase, has already been built and is currently being commissioned and tested in the laboratory.},

abstract = {ASTRI SST-2M is one of the prototypes of the small size class of telescopes proposed for the Cherenkov Telescope Array. Its optical design is based on a dual-mirror Schwarzschild-Couder configuration, and the camera is composed by a matrix of monolithic multipixel silicon photomultipliers managed by ad-hoc tailored front-end electronics. This paper describes the procedures for the gain calibration on the ASTRI SST-2M. Since the SiPM gain depends on the operative voltage and the temperature, we adjust the operative voltages for all sensors to have equal gains at a reference temperature. We then correct gain variations caused by temperature changes by adjusting the operating voltage of each sensor. For that purpose the SiPM gain dependence on operating voltage and on temperature have been measured. In addition, we present the calibration procedures and the results of the experimental measurements to evaluate, for each pixel, the parameters necessary to make the trigger uniform over the whole focal plane.},

abstract = {Until April 2007 the Major Atmospheric Gamma ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescope used a 300 MSamples/s flash analog-to-digital converter (FADC) system to sample the shaped photomultiplier tube (PMT) signals produced by the captured Cherenkov photons of air showers. Different algorithms to reconstruct the signal from the read-out samples (extractors) have been implemented and are described and compared. Criteria based on the obtained charge and time resolution/bias are defined and used to judge the different extractors, by applying them to calibration, cosmic and pedestal signals. The achievable charge and time resolution have been derived as functions of the number of incident photo-electrons. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {VERITAS employs a 12m segmented mirror and pixellated photomultiplier tube camera to detect the brief pulse of Cherenkov radiation produced by the extensive air shower initiated by a cosmic high-energy gamma ray. The VERITAS data acquisition system consists of a 500 Mega-Sample-Per-Second custom-built flash ADC system, which samples the Cherenkov light pulse every 2 nanoseconds. The integrated charge in each flash ADC channel is proportional to the amount of Cherenkov light incident on the corresponding photomultiplier tube. Accurate reconstruction of the integrated charge is required for accurate energy estimation and spectral reconstruction. A reliable calculation of the integrated charge at low intensities can lead to a reduction in the energy threshold of the system, and an increase in sensitivity. This paper investigates and compares several approaches for evaluating the integrated charge. The Cherenkov pulse timing information in the flash ADC readout has the potential to assist in background rejection techniques. Various methods for extracting the timing information are investigated and excellent timing resolution is achieved.},

abstract = {This thesis concerns a study to determine new methods of analysing data taken with VERITAS, a new array of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, and the application of these methods to astrophysical observations of blazars during the array-commissioning phase. The VERITAS array uses a data acquisition system which employs custom-built hardware to record the tem-poral development of the extensive air shower which occurs when a very high-energy gamma ray strikes the atmosphere. A suite of analysis tools are developed, investigated and optimised in order to determine the most suitable mechanism for analysing these data. Following this study, the new analysis tools are applied to observations of the Crab Nebula, a steady source of TeV gamma rays in the northern hemisphere. The Crab Nebula data are used to optimise and calibrate the analysis. This analysis is applied to very high-energy observations of the blazars 1ES 0647+250, 1ES 0806+524 and 1ES 2344+514. Although no emission is detected from any of these objects, constraining upper limits on the integral flux above 0.3 TeV are derived. The upper limit on TeV emission above 0.3 TeV from 1ES 0806+525 is less than that predicted by one of the emission models studied. Concurrent x-ray ob-servations of the three blazars with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer are used to find enhanced x-ray emission during one of the VERITAS exposures on 1ES 0647+250.},

abstract = {The next-generation very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray observatory, the Cherenkov Telescope Array, will feature dozens of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), each with thousands of pixels of photo-sensors. To be affordable and reliable, reading out such an array of up to a million channels requires event recording technology that is highly integrated and modular, with a low cost per channel. We present the design and performance of a chip targeted to this application: the TeV Array Readout with GSa/s sampling and Event Trigger (TARGET). This application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) has 16 parallel input channels, a 4096-sample buffer for each channel, adjustable input termination, self-trigger functionality, and tight window-selected readout. We report the performance of the first-generation version of this chip (TARGET 1) in terms of sampling frequency, power consumption, dynamic range, current-mode gain, analog bandwidth, and cross talk. The large number of channels per chip allows a low cost per channel ({\$}10 to {\$}20 including front-end and back-end electronics but not including photosensors) to be achieved with a TARGET-based IACT readout system. In addition to basic performance parameters of the TARGET 1 chip, we present a camera module prototype as well as a second-generation chip (TARGET 2), both of which have now been produced.{\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Gamma-ray Cherenkov Telescope (GCT) is a candidate for the Small Size Telescopes (SSTs) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). Its purpose is to extend the sensitivity of CTA to gamma-ray energies reaching 300 TeV. Its dual-mirror optical design and curved focal plane enables the use of a compact camera of 0.4 m diameter, while achieving a field of view of above 8 degrees. Through the use of the digitising TARGET ASICs, the Cherenkov flash is sampled once per nanosecond continuously and then digitised when triggering conditions are met within the analogue outputs of the photosensors. Entire waveforms (typically covering 96 ns) for all 2048 pixels are then stored for analysis, allowing for a broad spectrum of investigations to be performed on the data. Two prototypes of the GCT camera are under development, with differing photosensors: Multi-Anode Photomultipliers (MAPMs) and Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). During November 2015, the GCT MAPM (GCT-M) prototype camera was integrated onto the GCT structure at the Observatoire de Paris-Meudon, where it observed the first Cherenkov light detected by a prototype instrument for CTA.},

abstract = {We present a high-performance event reconstruction algorithm: an Image Pixel-wise fit for Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (ImPACT). The reconstruction algorithm is based around the likelihood fitting of camera pixel amplitudes to an expected image template. A maximum likelihood fit is performed to find the best-fit shower parameters. A related reconstruction algorithm has already been shown to provide significant improvements over traditional reconstruction for both the CAT and H.E.S.S. experiments. We demonstrate a significant improvement to the template generation step of the procedure, by the use of a full Monte Carlo air shower simulation in combination with a ray-tracing optics simulation to more accurately model the expected camera images. This reconstruction step is combined with an MVA-based background rejection. Examples are shown of the performance of the ImPACT analysis on both simulated and measured (from a strong VHE source) gamma-ray data from the H.E.S.S. array, demonstrating an improvement in sensitivity of more than a factor two in observation time over traditional image moments-fitting methods, with comparable performance to previous likelihood fitting analyses. ImPACT is a particularly promising approach for future large arrays such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) due to its improved high-energy performance and suitability for arrays of mixed telescope types. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) have resulted in a break-through in very-high energy (VHE) gamma-ray astrophysics. While early IACT installations faced the problem of detecting any sources at all, current instruments are able to see many sources, often over more than two orders of magnitude in energy. As instruments and analysis methods have matured, the requirements for calibration and modelling of physical and instrumental effects have increased. In this article, a set of Monte Carlo simulation tools is described that attempts to include all relevant effects for IACTs in great detail but aims to achieve this in an efficient and flexible way. These tools were originally developed for the HEGRA IACT system and later adapted for the H.E.S.S. experiment. Their inherent flexibility to describe quite arbitrary IACT systems makes them also an ideal tool for evaluating the potential of future installations.

An overview is presented of how images are processed and parametrized, prior to 0954-3899/23/9/004/img2/hadron separation. In the context of rejection strategies, the deleterious muon background is also discussed. The gradual evolution of a number of dedicated 0954-3899/23/9/004/img2/hadron separation strategies is summarized from the standpoint of both single and multiple telescope operation. The review concludes with an overview of astrophysical accomplishments to date, based on successful application of proven 0954-3899/23/9/004/img2/hadron separation strategies.

Monte Carlo simulations are a crucial tool in the design of CTA. The ultimate goal of these simulations is tofind the most cost-effective solution for given physics goals and thus sensitivity goals or to find, for a given cost, the solution best suited for different types of targets with CTA. Apart from uncertain component cost estimates, the main problem in this procedure is the dependence on a huge number of configuration parameters, both in specifications of individual telescope types and in the array layout. This is addressed by simulation of a huge array intended as a superset of many different realistic array layouts, and also by simulation of array subsets for different telescope parameters. Different analysis methods-inuse with current installations andextended (or developed specifically) for CTA -are applied to the simulated data sets for deriving the expected sensitivity of CTA. In this paper we describe the current status of this iterative approach to optimize the CTA design and layout. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The particles are tracked through the atmosphere until they undergo reactions with the air nuclei or - in the case of instable secondaries - decay. The hadronic interactions at high energies may be described by five reaction models alternatively: The VENUS, QGSJET, and DPMJET models are based on the Gribov-Regge theory, while SIBYLL is a minijet model. HDPM is a phenomenological generator and adjusted to experimental data wherever possible. Hadronic interactions at lower energies are described either by the more sophisticated GHEISHA interaction routines or the rather simple ISOBAR model. In particle decays all decay branches down to the 1{\%} level are taken into account. For electromagnetic interactions the shower program EGS4 or the analytical NKG formulas may be used.
