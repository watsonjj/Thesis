abstract = {H.E.S.S.-the high energy stereoscopic system-is a new system of large atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes for GeV/TeV astronomy. Each of the four telescopes of 107 m2mirror area is equipped with a 960-pixel photomultiplier-tube camera. This paper describes the methods used to convert the photomultiplier signals into the quantities needed for Cherenkov image analysis. Two independent calibration techniques have been applied in parallel to provide an estimation of uncertainties. Results on the long-term stability of the H.E.S.S. cameras are also presented. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Different algorithms to reconstruct the signal from the read-out samples (extractors) have been implemented and are described and compared. Criteria based on the obtained charge and time resolution/bias are defined and used to judge the different extractors, by applying them to calibration, cosmic and pedestal signals.

abstract = {VERITAS employs a 12m segmented mirror and pixellated photomultiplier tube camera to detect the brief pulse of Cherenkov radiation produced by the extensive air shower initiated by a cosmic high-energy gamma ray. The VERITAS data acquisition system consists of a 500 Mega-Sample-Per-Second custom-built flash ADC system, which samples the Cherenkov light pulse every 2 nanoseconds. The integrated charge in each flash ADC channel is proportional to the amount of Cherenkov light incident on the corresponding photomultiplier tube. Accurate reconstruction of the integrated charge is required for accurate energy estimation and spectral reconstruction. A reliable calculation of the integrated charge at low intensities can lead to a reduction in the energy threshold of the system, and an increase in sensitivity. This paper investigates and compares several approaches for evaluating the integrated charge. The Cherenkov pulse timing information in the flash ADC readout has the potential to assist in background rejection techniques. Various methods for extracting the timing information are investigated and excellent timing resolution is achieved.},

abstract = {This thesis concerns a study to determine new methods of analysing data taken with VERITAS, a new array of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, and the application of these methods to astrophysical observations of blazars during the array-commissioning phase. The VERITAS array uses a data acquisition system which employs custom-built hardware to record the tem-poral development of the extensive air shower which occurs when a very high-energy gamma ray strikes the atmosphere. A suite of analysis tools are developed, investigated and optimised in order to determine the most suitable mechanism for analysing these data. Following this study, the new analysis tools are applied to observations of the Crab Nebula, a steady source of TeV gamma rays in the northern hemisphere. The Crab Nebula data are used to optimise and calibrate the analysis. This analysis is applied to very high-energy observations of the blazars 1ES 0647+250, 1ES 0806+524 and 1ES 2344+514. Although no emission is detected from any of these objects, constraining upper limits on the integral flux above 0.3 TeV are derived. The upper limit on TeV emission above 0.3 TeV from 1ES 0806+525 is less than that predicted by one of the emission models studied. Concurrent x-ray ob-servations of the three blazars with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer are used to find enhanced x-ray emission during one of the VERITAS exposures on 1ES 0647+250.},

abstract = {The next-generation very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray observatory, the Cherenkov Telescope Array, will feature dozens of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), each with thousands of pixels of photo-sensors. To be affordable and reliable, reading out such an array of up to a million channels requires event recording technology that is highly integrated and modular, with a low cost per channel. We present the design and performance of a chip targeted to this application: the TeV Array Readout with GSa/s sampling and Event Trigger (TARGET). This application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) has 16 parallel input channels, a 4096-sample buffer for each channel, adjustable input termination, self-trigger functionality, and tight window-selected readout. We report the performance of the first-generation version of this chip (TARGET 1) in terms of sampling frequency, power consumption, dynamic range, current-mode gain, analog bandwidth, and cross talk. The large number of channels per chip allows a low cost per channel ({\$}10 to {\$}20 including front-end and back-end electronics but not including photosensors) to be achieved with a TARGET-based IACT readout system. In addition to basic performance parameters of the TARGET 1 chip, we present a camera module prototype as well as a second-generation chip (TARGET 2), both of which have now been produced.{\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {TARGET 5 is a new application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) of the TARGET family, designed for the readout of signals from photosensors in the cameras of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) for ground-based gamma-ray astronomy. TARGET 5 combines sampling and digitization on 16 signal channels with the formation of trigger signals based on the analog sum of groups of four channels. We describe the ASIC architecture and performance. TARGET 5 improves over the performance of the first-generation TARGET ASIC, achieving: tunable sampling frequency from {\textless}0.4 GSa/s to {\textgreater}1 GSa/s; a dynamic range on the data path of 1.2 V with effective dynamic range of 11 bits and DC noise of ∼0.6 mV; 3-dB bandwidth of 500 MHz; crosstalk between adjacent channels {\textless}1.3{\%}; charge resolution improving from 40{\%} to {\textless}4{\%} between 3 photoelectrons (p.e.) and {\textgreater}100 p.e. (assuming 4 mV per p.e.); and minimum stable trigger threshold of 20 mV (5 p.e.) with trigger noise of 5 mV (1.2 p.e.), which is mostly limited by interference between trigger and sampling operations. TARGET 5 is the first ASIC of the TARGET family used in an IACT prototype, providing one development path for readout electronics in the forthcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).},
