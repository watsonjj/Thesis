\change[inline]{big diff between MC and the lab is the potential cross talk in the electronics and the effect e.g. of ground bounce - difference in full camera illumination}


\section{Charge Resolution}

% The standard low-level criterion for performance used in \gls{cta} is the \textit{Charge Resolution}. It encompasses both the bias and the standard deviation of the extracted charge versus the expected charge to provide a measure of the waveform, calibration, and charge reconstruction quality. The \gls{cta} requirement \change[inline]{requirement label} (Chapter~\ref{ch3-architecture}) defines a limit which must be met for resolving the signal for any telescope in \gls{cta}.
