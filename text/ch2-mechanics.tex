\section{Introduction}

Due to the design of \gls{gct} as a dual-mirror Schwarzschild-Couder telescope, it is capable of a \SI{9}{\degree} \gls{fov} \change{intro: talk about benefit of high FoV} while simultaneously reducing the plate scale by a factor of $\sim 3$ compared to single-telescope designs. This large reduction in plate scale allows for a much more compact camera, for which novel opportunities in photosensor technology exist \cite{Vassiliev2007}. The camera that has been developed for \gls{gct} is appropriately known as the \glsf{chec}.

Two designs have been implemented for \gls{chec}, each featuring a different multi-pixel photon-counting sensor technology. A \glsf{mapmt} based camera known as \gls{chec-m} was the first to be commissioned, and received its inauguration on the \gls{gct} telescope structure at the Observatoire de Paris-Meudon in November 2015 \cite{Watson2017}. A second camera, known as \gls{chec-s}, is currently undergoing commissioning at the Max-Planck-Institut für Kernphysik in Heidelberg, Germany. This camera utilises \glsfpl{sipmt} as a photosensor. \gls{chec-s} also features upgrades the digitisation chain that were developed since the commissioning of \gls{chec-m}.

This chapter will describe the components of the \glsf{chec}, covering the photosensor, \gls{fee} and \gls{bee}. These descriptions will be focussed on the factors contributed by the electronics that have a significant influence on the low-level calibration and performance investigations covered in this thesis. Furthermore, the external components and laboratory set-up will be described. Finally, the data output of the camera is described, with specific focus on the characteristics of the waveform readout. The calibration and analysis of these waveforms obtained from the full camera electronics chain is the primary focus of this thesis.

\section{Photosensors}

For a photosensor to be useful to \glspl{iact}, it must be:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sensitive to Cherenkov (blue) light.
\item Fast in its response to a signal, which is required to detect the prompt Cherenkov shower flashes.
\item Cheap, allowing large arrays of them to be combined to fill the full plate scale of the telescope and provide high spatial resolution of the shower.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Photomultiplier Tubes}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pmt} 
	\caption[Diagram of a Photomultiplier Tube.]{Common diagram of a Photomultiplier Tube (box-and-grid type) \cite{Hamamatsu2016}.}
	\label{fig:pmt}
\end{figure}

Since the inception of the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Technique, the photosensors used for \gls{iact} cameras have almost exclusively been \glsfpl{pmt} \cite{Weekes2003}. These detectors operate as photon counting devices, where the charge produced by a single photon is amplified into a large current signal that can be read out. The components of a \gls{pmt} are as follows (using Figure~\ref{fig:pmt} for reference):
\begin{description}
\item [Photocathode] Produces electrons from incident photons via the photoelectric effect. These electrons are often referred to as ``photoelectrons''. Associated with a photocathode is its wavelength-dependant probability that photon will be converted into a photoelectron. This is known as its \gls{qe}, and is determined by the compound it is made of. The photocathodes in \glspl{pmt} are typically sensitive to visible light, with a \gls{qe} that peaks at \SI{\sim 30}{\percent} for \SI{\sim 400}{nm} (for the best photocathodes) \cite{Hamamatsu2016}.
\item [Focusing Electrode] Ensures that photoelectrons produced at the edges of the photocathode are focussed onto the first dynode.
\item [Electron Multiplier] The \gls{hv} across the \gls{pmt} accelerates the photoelectrons to the first dynode. Upon the impact, the dynode will release a further amount of electrons, the number of which is proportional to the kinetic energy of the incident electron. These secondary electrons are then accelerated to the next dynode, which has a higher voltage than the previous dynode. 
where $A$ 
\item [Anode] The total result of the dynode chain is a proportional amplification from the initial photocathode current $I_c$ to the output anode current $I_a$. The proportionality factor is known as the gain of the photomultiplier. The gain $G$ depends on the number of dynode stages $n$, and the value of high voltage applied $V$ \cite{Hamamatsu2016}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:pmt_gain}
G = \frac{I_a}{I_c} = k V^{\alpha n},
\end{equation}
where $k$ is a constant that depends on the photomultiplier design, and $\alpha$ is a coefficient determined by the dynode material and geometric structure (typically has values around 0.7 to 0.8).
\end{description}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{pmt_time} 
	\caption[Photomultiplier Tube timing characteristics.]{Typical values for the timing response of a Photomultiplier Tube~\cite{Hamamatsu2016}.}
	\label{fig:pmt_time}
\end{figure}

Due to their wide usage across many fields, \glspl{pmt} are available at a very reasonable cost. The timing response of \glspl{pmt} faithfully reproduce the incident light pulse, however the anode's pulse rise time property does modify the response slightly \cite{Hamamatsu2016}. Additionally, there is a delay in signal due to the electron transit time along the dynode chain. This transit time has an associated ``transit time spread'' due to the different paths the electrons may take in the dynode chain. These time response characteristics are dependant on the dynode structure and applied voltage. Examples of the typical timing response values are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pmt_time}.

Beyond their low \gls{qe}, a second disadvantage of a \gls{pmt} is its high voltage requirement \cite{Weekes2003}. Furthermore, since \glspl{pmt} generally have $\sim 10$ dynode stages, Equation~\ref{eq:pmt_gain} dictates that a small change in voltage will result in a large variation in gain. The high voltage supply therefore needs to be extremely stable \cite{Hamamatsu2016}. This is particularly unfavourable for the application of \glspl{pmt} in \glspl{iact}, due to the typical remoteness of the telescopes. A third disadvantage is the robustness of a \gls{pmt}, as they are very sensitive to light and can be permanently damaged if exposed to bright sources, such as the full moon. This disadvantage can limit the amount of observation time that is safe for the telescopes.

\subsection{Multi-Anode Photomultiplier Tubes}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{mapmt} 
	\caption[Internals of a Multi-anode Photomultiplier Tube.]{Electrode structure of a Multi-anode Photomultiplier Tube, demonstrating an example electron multiplication trajectory~\cite{HAMAMATSU2007}.}
	\label{fig:mapmt}
\end{figure}

In order to be compatible with the reduced plate scale of the telescope, more compact options than \glspl{pmt} must be found. An extension to the \gls{pmt} technology is the \glsf{mapmt}. This photosensor consists of many \glspl{pmt} arranged in a compact grid to provide position-sensitive detection of light. A diagram of the internal dynode structure for \glspl{mapmt} is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mapmt}. The chosen \gls{mapmt} model for \gls{chec-m} is the Hamamatsu H10966B . This flat panel type \gls{mapmt} features an $8 \times 8$ multianode, resulting in 64 pixels per \gls{mapmt}. The entire module's diameter is \SI{49}{mm}, while each pixel has a diameter of \SI{\sim 6}{mm}. It provides a \gls{qe} of \SI{\sim 30}{\percent} at \SI{400}{nm} wavelength, a typical gain of $3.3 \times 10^5$, and a typical anode rise time and transit time of \SI{0.4}{ns} and \SI{4}{ns}, respectively \cite{Hamamatsu2011}. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{mapmt_crosstalk} 
	\caption[Multi-anode Photomultiplier Tube crosstalk.]{Example of the crosstalk present in an MAPMT, measured by using a fibre~\cite{Hamamatsu2011}.}
	\label{fig:mapmt_crosstalk}
\end{figure}

An important concern when using an \gls{mapmt} is the crosstalk. This is the measure of how accurately the signal readout retains its positional information. It is hampered by the broadening of the electron flow in the photocathode and dynode chain. The crosstalk characteristics presented in the technical document for Hamamatsu H10966B are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mapmt_crosstalk}.

\subsection{Silicon Photomultipliers}

For a photosensor to be considered as a replacement for the tried-and-trusted \gls{pmt} technology within \gls{iact} astronomy, it must deliver a higher \gls{qe} for a comparable cost. \glspl{sipmt}, or its solid state single photon detector precursors, have been actively developed since the 1960s \cite{Renker2006}. They have recently matured into a feasible replacement for traditional \gls{pmt} technology, causing a transitioning trend in the majority of fields that previously relied on \glspl{pmt}. The physics behind \gls{sipmt} technology is more complicated than that of \glspl{pmt}, so I shall begin with a description of how \glspl{sipmt} operate before returning to the discussion on their application within \glspl{iact}. 

\subsubsection{The P-N Junction}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pn_junction} 
	\caption[A typical illustration of a P-N Junction.]{My own illustration of a P-N Junction, inspired by \textcite{Ghassemi2017}.}
	\label{fig:pn_junction}
\end{figure}

As with all solid state devices, the building blocks of \glspl{sipmt} are P-N Junctions. A p- and n-type material are created by the addition of impurities to a semiconducting material such as silicon. The impurities added to produce the n-type semiconductor increases its number of freely moving electrons, while the impurities added to produce the p-type semiconductor increases its number of freely moving holes. When the two materials are joined, the P-N Junction is formed. As a result of the abundance of charges in each material, a diffusion current forms with electrons moving from the n-type material (leaving behind its immobile positive ions) to combine with the holes in the p-type material. The same occurs vice versa for the excess holes in the p-type material, leaving behind its immobile negative ions. The result is a region adjacent to the junction with no free charges remaining, known as the depletion layer (Figure~\ref{fig:pn_junction}). The charge difference from the immobile ions  produces an electric field inside the depletion layer, that points from its positively charged N side to its negatively charge P side. This electric field opposes the diffusion current and causes an equilibrium to be reached across the junction.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{pn_bandgap} 
	\caption[Illustration of the silicon bandgap.]{Illustration of the silicon bandgap, demonstrating a bound electron being exited into an excess charge carrier via the photoelectric effect. The excess charge carrier is then accelerated in the opposite direction of the electric field, resulting in a current \cite{Ghassemi2017}.}
	\label{fig:pn_bandgap}
\end{figure}

However, this equilibrium can be disturbed by the input of energy into the system, either by thermal excitation (producing what is known as \textit{dark counts}) or by the photoelectric effect. If the energy provided to a bound electron is greater than the band gap energy (inherent to the semiconductor) then it becomes an excess charge carrier, leaving behind a hole. These excess charge carriers are known as an electron-hole pair. If these excess charge carrier are produced in the depletion layer, they will travel along the electric field in the direction according to its charge. For example, an excess electron charge carrier released in the P side of the depletion layer will travel in the opposite direction to the electric field, crossing the P-N Junction to the N side. This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:pn_bandgap}. If a connection is formed between the P and N regions, this process will produce a current. If excess charge carriers are freed outside the depletion layer, they are generally short-lived, as there is no significant electric field to accelerate them, and therefore no net current is produced.

\subsubsection{Avalanche PhotoDiode (APD)}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{pn_reversebias} 
	\caption[Diagram of an Avalanche PhotoDiode.]{Diagram of an Avalanche PhotoDiode with a reverse bias voltage applied. The N side of the semiconductor acts as the cathode. Traditionally the cathode is the ``negative electrode'', however in reverse bias the N side is connected to the positive terminal. The P side of the semiconductor acts as the anode. Similarly to the N side, although the anode is the name traditionally given to the ``positive electrode'', in reverse bias the P side is connected to the negative terminal. The result is the electrons are accelerated to the N side cathode, while holes are accelerated to the P side anode \cite{Ghassemi2017}.}
	\label{fig:pn_reversebias}
\end{figure}

In order to maximise the photosensitivity of the semiconductor, the depletion layer depth must be maximised. To achieve this, a reverse bias voltage is applied to the semiconductor. This means biasing the N side (cathode) to a higher electric potential that the P side (anode). The result of this is the freely-mobile holes on the P side, and the freely-mobile electrons on the N side, are pulled away from the junction. This leaves behind the charged ions and causes the depth of the depletion region to increase.

In addition to an increased depletion layer depth, this reverse bias results in an increase in the electric field within the depletion region. Excess charge carriers achieve a higher kinetic energy as a result. If the mean kinetic energy attained between collisions with ions is greater than the band gap energy, additional charge carriers may be released. This impact ionisation effect results in a rapid multiplication of excess charge carriers, and is referred to as an avalanche. Such a device it therefore known as an \gls{apd}. The ratio of final charge carrier signal that is read out to the initial photo-carriers produced is the gain of the \gls{apd}, analogous to the gain of a \gls{pmt}.

The typical operation of a \gls{apd} is to apply the bias voltage that optimally maintains relatively constant bandwidth and stable noise output, while achieving the highest gain level \cite{Ghassemi2017}. This voltage occurs before the \textit{breakdown voltage}, where the gain approach infinity. This operation of the \gls{apd} is known as ``proportional'' or ``linear'' mode \cite{Otte2006}, as the gain increases proportionally with bias voltage. However, \glspl{apd} in this mode suffer from limited gain and large variations in their single amplification, and are therefore not useful in single photon counting. To better utilise \glspl{apd} we must increase the bias voltage beyond the breakdown voltage, causing the \gls{apd} to transition into Geiger mode.

\subsubsection{Geiger-mode Avalanche PhotoDiode (G-APD)}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{gapd_cycle} 
	\caption[G-APD reverse bias voltage cycle.]{Diagram of the current created by the avalanche versus reverse bias voltage \cite{SensL2011}. The stages in the cycle of the G-APD operation are labelled. 1) The G-APD is set to a reverse bias voltage above the breakdown voltage. No current flows yet. 2) A excess charge carrier is produced by thermal excitation or the photoelectric effect. The carrier causes a Geiger discharge, creating a macroscopic current. 3) The current is quenched by a resistor in series with the diode. The bias voltage across the diode is reduced below the breakdown voltage, and the avalanche ceases. The G-APD then recharges ready for the next avalanche.}
	\label{fig:gapd_cycle}
\end{figure}

In Geiger mode, a single photoelectron produces a self-perpetuating ionisation cascade. This effectively causes the silicon to become conductive, thereby amplifying the original electron-hole pair into a measurable current flow \cite{SensL2011}. A ``quenching resistor'' is used in series with the diode to limit the current drawn during breakdown, thereby lowering the bias voltage across the diode and bringing it below the breakdown voltage. This halts the avalanche and results in a signal shape that can be read out from the voltage across the quenching resistor. The \gls{sipm} then undergoes a recovery back to the original ``overvolatage'' above the breakdown voltage, ready for the next photoelectron avalanche. This operation cycle of the \gls{gapd} is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gapd_cycle}.

The disadvantage of this mode is that the \gls{gapd} is a binary device. All information about the number of generated photoelectrons in the semiconductor is lost. The only knowledge one can have is that there was at least one photoelectron. However, the response that results from this signal, completely independent of the number of initial photoelectrons, is extremely large and well defined, with a gain in the range $10^5$-$10^7$. The gain of an \gls{gapd} is characterised with the equation:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:sipmt_gain}
G = \frac{C \Delta V}{e},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:sipmt_gain}
\Delta V = V_{bias} - V_{br},
\end{equation}
where $C$ is the capacitance of the diode, $e$ is the electron charge, and $\Delta V$ is the overvoltage, $V_{bias}$ is the bias voltage, and $V_{br}$ is the breakdown voltage. \glspl{gapd} are therefore very useful as single photon counting devices, but are not so useful for \glspl{iact}. 

\subsubsection{Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM)}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{sipmt_circuit} 
	\caption[Simplified equivalent circuit of an SiPM detector.]{Simplified equivalent circuit of an SiPM detector, demonstrating the individual microcells connected in parallel \cite{Marano2014}.}
	\label{fig:sipmt_circuit}
\end{figure}

The final transition in this technology chain is to the concept of the \gls{sipmt}. This device utilises a densely packed array of up to 10,000 \glspl{gapd} per \si{mm\squared}. Each of these \gls{gapd} ``microcells'' has its own quenching resistor, and all the microcells are connected in parallel to a common bus \cite{Otte2006}. Figure~\ref{fig:sipmt_circuit} shows a simplification of the equivalent circuit diagram for an \gls{sipmt}. The result is a detector that can count multiple photons, with a dynamic range that is essentially the number of microcells. Though, each microcell still operates as a binary sensor, therefore two photons incident on the same cell will only register as one. The superposition of the output current pulses from all the microcells results in the highly quantised measure of the number of photoelectrons produced.

The major factors that make modern iterations of \gls{sipmt} technology an appealing replacement for \glspl{pmt} are outlined by \textcite{Ghassemi2017}:
\begin{itemize}
\item The transition probability of a photoelectron from a silicon crystal’s valence band to its conduction band is higher than the emission probability achievable in an alkali-based photocathode. This factor results in a higher attainable \gls{qe}. 
\item The semiconductor properties of silicon enable a high collection efficiency of photoelectron charge, resulting in a reduced spread in the amplification of a single photoelectron in comparison to \glspl{pmt} (in the absence of optical crosstalk considerations, see Section~\ref{section:enf})
\item The high electrical conductance of doped silicon enables the low-voltage (of the order of \SIrange{10}{100}{V}) operation of an \gls{sipmt}.
\item The high fill factor of \gls{sipmt} pixels and the compactness of the tiles allow a reduced dead space.
\item The mechanical reliability in terms of its ageing/warm-up considerations is much better than in \glspl{pmt}, as well as its performance in magnetic fields.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Performance Parameters of SiPMs}

In addition to the gain which has already been characterised earlier in this section, it is important to detail the other parameters that are significant in \glspl{sipmt}. Firstly, the \gls{pde} of an \gls{sipm} is the measure of its wavelength-dependant sensitivity to photons. Due to the microcell structure, this property differs slightly to the \gls{qe} of a \gls{pmt}. Qualitatively, it is the statistical probability that an incident photon produces an avalanche. Quantitatively, as shown in the sensL \gls{sipm} technical note \cite{SensL2011}, it is defined as the product between the silicon's:
\begin{description}
\item [Quantum Efficiency $\eta(\lambda)$] Likelihood of a photon producing an electron-hole pair. 
\item [Avalanche Initiation Probability $\epsilon(V)$] Probability of a produced excess charge carrier initiating an avalanche.
\item [Fill Factor $F$] Ratio of active to inactive area.
\end{description}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:sipmt_gain}
PDE(\lambda, V) = \eta(\lambda) \cdot \epsilon(V) \cdot F.
\end{equation}

Additionally, in order to capture the short flash duration of the shower (typically only a few to a few tens of nanoseconds) the photosensors must be fast, and be coupled with high-speed digitising electronics. These two components, the photosensors and digitisers, are the defining characteristics of \gls{chec}.

% In order to obtain reliable knowledge on the average illumination incident on the camera in our laboratory, it was necessary to calibrate the laser and filter wheel combination. This was of paramount importance for performing the camera flat-field calibration, and for obtaining a laboratory charge resolution result. There exists three stages required to achieve a calibration from filter-wheel position to average expected charge in each pixel:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Measuring the relationship between filter-wheel position and light transmissivity.
% \item Measuring the relative amount of light each pixel receives due to its position on the focal surface.
% \item Measuring an absolute illumination in photoelectrons for at least one filter-wheel position.
% \end{enumerate}
% Through combining the results of these stages, a conversion from filter-wheel position to expected number of photoelectrons in each pixel was obtained.

% \end{figure}

% The calibration of the filter wheel was performed in two stages: an initial measurement with a reference \gls{sipmt} in order to obtain an approximate handle on the relative illumination, and a secondary correction using the camera at different gain settings.

% \subsubsection{Reference SiPMT}

% Using a single reference silicon photomultiplier pixel connected to an oscilloscope, centred on the camera focal plane, the ratio between the signal with and without the neutral-density filter was calculated for different filter-wheel positions (i.e. different attenuations). As the dynamic range of the reference \gls{sipmt} was limited, in order to cover the full range of filters attenuations, three approaches were utilised:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item \textbf{Low-range} - Average illumination obtained from \gls{spe} spectrum, with a pre-amplifier attached to the \gls{sipmt}.
% \item \textbf{Mid-range} - Average pulse area, with a pre-amplifier attached to the \gls{sipmt}.
% \item \textbf{High-range} - Average pulse area, with no pre-amplifier attached.
% \end{enumerate}
% The overlapping values from each method were used to stitch the datasets together. The resulting points, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fw_position}, were then used as a lookup table for the conversion from filter-wheel position to transmission.

% \subsubsection{Camera Correction}

% When looking at the average measured charge across the camera as a function of transmission, for three datasets where each has different bias voltages applied to the photosensors, features that share a position on the X axis can only occur from artefacts of the previous filter-wheel calibration. Figure~\ref{fig:measured_versus_transmission} indicates some of the artefacts which are easy to see. The measured charge was then converted into an ``effective transmission'' using the relation in Figure~\ref{fig:measured_versus_transmission}. By plotting the ``effective transmission'' against filter-wheel position, a new conversion from filter-wheel position to transmission was obtained from the fit shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fw_correction}.

% \subsection{Illumination Profile} \label{section:illumination_profile}

% Two contributions influence the relative amount of light each pixel receives, depending on its position on the camera focal surface. The first is due to the laser uniformity characteristics, the second is due to the curved focal surface of the camera.

% \subsubsection{Laser Profile}

% \begin{figure}
% 	\centering
%     %\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fw_position_justus} 
% 	\caption[Lab laser profile]{Spatial profile of the laser illumination along a flat plane in front of the camera, measured with a single reference \gls{sipmt} pixel attached to a robot arm. \change[inline]{Show value in each position, and then gradient fit?}.}
% 	\label{fig:light_profile}
% \end{figure}

% Despite attempts to homogenise the illumination from the laser-diffuser combination, there are still non-uniformities in the light received at the camera pixels that needed to be accounted for in the calibration. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:light_profile}, a linear gradient in laser illumination exists across the x-y plane. This was found by attaching a single silicon photomultiplier pixel to a robot arm, and placing it at the camera position in from of the laser. Through the use of a single pixel, the amplitude measured is disentangled from the relative PDE. This pixel was then moved to each x-y position to calculate the ratio in signal amplitude, returning back to the origin to obtain a fresh value for comparison, thereby correcting for any deviations that may have occurred due to a change in temperature. The resulting distribution of ratios was fit with a linear gradient across the plane.

% \subsubsection{Camera Geometry}

% \begin{figure}
% 	\centering
%     \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{laser_geometry} 
% 	\caption[Camera geometry correction schematic]{Two-dimensional geometry schematic of the laboratory set-up for uniform camera illumination, used to calculate the reduction in light level for each pixel depending on its distance from the camera centre.}
% 	\label{fig:laser_geometry}
% \end{figure}

% \change[inline]{Talk about how this is an approximation - modules are fixed along focal plane, light-source is somewhat between pointlike and at infinity, quote percentage that difference makes}

% \change[inline]{Add not to scale on figure}

% Due to the spherical camera focal surface, each pixel is at a different distance $d_z$ from the light-source, and therefore receives a different amount of light depending on its distance $x$ from the camera centre. Furthermore, at a ``viewing angle'' $\beta$, i.e. the angle between the normal to the pixel and the light-source, the amount of surface area of the pixel $A_P$ visible to the light-source is reduced. The visible surface area is known as the ``viewing area'' $A_V$. The combined geometric correction to the light intensity required to compensate for these effects is almost circularly symmetric, and therefore can be analytically approximated by using a two dimensional description of the camera, with a circular focal surface:

% \begin{equation} \label{eq:geom_distance1}
% d_1 = r - d_2 = r - \sqrt{r^2 - x^2},
% \end{equation}
% \begin{equation} \label{eq:geom_distance2}
% d_z = \sqrt{x^2 + (d_c + d_1)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + (d_c + r - \sqrt{r^2 - x^2})^2}.
% \end{equation}
% \begin{equation} \label{eq:viewing_area1}
% \beta = \theta + \alpha = \sin^{-1}{\frac{x}{d_z}} + \sin^{-1}{\frac{x}{r}},
% \end{equation}
% \begin{equation} \label{eq:viewing_area2}
% \frac{A_V}{A_P} = \cos{\beta},
% \end{equation}
% \begin{equation} \label{eq:geom_correction}
% \frac{I_x}{I_c} = \frac{d_z^2}{d_c^2} \times \cos{\beta},
% \end{equation}
% where $A_P$ is the pixel area, $I_x$ is the intensity measured at the position of the pixel, $I_c$ is the intensity measured at the centre of the camera, and the remaining distances and angles are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:laser_geometry}.

% The resulting geometry corrections to the intensity for each pixel, arising from Equation\ref{eq:geom_correction}, can be seen in Figure~\change{add figure}. 

% The final illumination profile correction, combining both the laser profile and camera geometry, is shown in Figure~\change{add figure}. The description used for this calibration is only an approximation to the lab set-up. The following factors cause deviations from this model:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The pixels are not precisely aligned on the spherical focal surface; the pixel angle is fixed to its module's angle. The modules are aligned on the spherical focal surface.
% \item The light source is not point-like. It produces a diffuse emission, which likely reflects along the walls of the box.
% \end{itemize}
% A future study could further improve on the models used for the illumination correction.

% \subsection{Absolute Illumination} \label{section:absolute_illumination}

% \begin{figure}
% 	\centering
%     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fw_calibration_fit} 
% 	\caption[Obtaining relationship between filter-wheel transmission and average illumination.]{Example of the linear regression to obtain the relationship between filter-wheel transmission and average illumination in photoelectrons ($\lambda$), for 5 pixels. The values of $\lambda$ are obtained from the simultaneous fits to the \gls{spe} spectra (Appendix~\ref{a1-spe}). The error bars on the points are the \si{1}{$\sigma$} parabolic errors obtained from the covariance matrix of the fit)}
% 	\label{fig:fw_calibration_fit}
% \end{figure}

% The method adopted to obtain a value for the absolute illumination was to use a fit to the \gls{spe} spectrum resulting from low-amplitude illumination of the pixels. Contained within this fit is the average illumination parameter, $\lambda$. The concept of the \gls{spe} fit is further covered in Chapter~\ref{ch5-calibration} and Appendix~\ref{a1-spe}.

% By simultaneously fitting three illuminations, we obtained three values of $\lambda$ per pixel. With the three filter-wheel transmissions (corresponding to the three illuminations) on the x-axis, these values of $\lambda$ were linearly regressed (weighted by the \si{1}{$\sigma$} parabolic error of the fit, $\sigma_\lambda$) to obtain the gradient $M_\lambda$ and y-intercept $C_\lambda$ per pixel. This linear regression is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fw_calibration_fit}. The y-intercept represents the value of $\lambda$ one would get with zero filter-wheel transmission, and therefore indicates the \gls{nsb} and \gls{dcr}. The variation in $M_\lambda$ across the pixels arises from the folding of the illumination profile and the relative \gls{pde}. Therefore, the next step was to correct for the illumination profile contribution to the gradient. The resulting spread of $M_\lambda$ is solely from the relative \gls{pde} (Figure~\change{add figure, in this chapter or results chapter?}). The calibration from filter-wheel transmission $T_\text{FW}$ to the average illumination across the whole camera $\average{I}_{pe}$ is then obtained by taking the averages of the linear regression coefficients:

% \begin{equation} \label{eq:average_camera_illumination}
% \average{I}_{pe} = \average{M}_\lambda T_\text{FW} + \average{C}_\lambda,
% \end{equation}

% \subsection{Average Expected Charge}

% \begin{figure}
% 	\centering
%     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fw_calibration} 
% 	\caption[Calibration from filter-wheel transmission to expected charge]{Relationship between filter-wheel transmission and average expected charge in photoelectrons resulting from the filter-wheel calibration. The black line shows the conversion for a theoretical pixel positioned exactly at the camera centre. The error bars are calculated from the weighted standard deviation of the gradient estimates between the pixels, explained in Section~\ref{section:fwerr}}
% 	\label{fig:fw_calibration}
% \end{figure}

% As we corrected for the \gls{nsb} in the extracted signal value (Section~\ref{section:photosensor_calib}), the \gls{nsb} contribution to Equation~\ref{eq:average_camera_illumination} ($\average{C}_\lambda$) is subtracted to give us the charge we expect when illuminating the camera with a filter-wheel transmission $T_\text{FW}$, for a theoretical pixel perfectly positioned at the camera centre. This relation is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fw_calibration}. To obtain the average expected charge $Q_\text{Exp}$ for each true camera pixel, this relation must be folded with the illumination profile correction factor $F_\text{pix}$:
% \begin{equation} \label{eq:average_expected_charge}
% Q_\text{Exp} = \average{M}_\lambda T_\text{FW}F_\text{pix}.
% \end{equation}
% This expression is important for the flat-fielding calibration (Chapter~\ref{ch5-calibration}) and the calculation of the \textit{Charge Resolution} for lab measurements (Chapter~\ref{ch7-performance}), as it tells us for a certain pixel and filter-wheel transmission, what charge we should expect to measure on average.

% \subsection{Consideration of Errors and Uncertainty} \label{section:fwerr}

% When performing the weighted linear regression between $\lambda_i$ and filter-wheel transmission $T_{FW_i}$ (with weights $w_i = \frac{1}{\sigma_{\lambda_i}^2}$ accounting for the parabolic error in $\lambda_i$), the standard error on the estimate of the gradient per pixel, $\sigma_{M_\lambda}$, can be calculated with the relation derived by \textcite{Taylor1997}:
% \begin{equation} \label{eq:wmerr}
% \sigma_{M_\lambda} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum w_i}{\sum w_i \sum w_i T_{FW_i}^2 - (\sum w_i T_{FW_i})^2}}, \quad i = 0, 1, 2, ..., N.
% \end{equation}

% During the correction for the illumination profile on the gradient estimates, the illumination correction factors were also applied to the standard error on the gradient estimate.

% While calculating the average gradient across the camera, $\average{M}_\lambda$, the individual gradient estimates were weighted by their corresponding standard error. To calculate an uncertainty on the resulting value for $\average{M}_\lambda$, the weighted standard deviation between the gradient estimates were also calculated. This uncertainty is illustrated in the error bars in Figure~\ref{fig:fw_calibration}. The resulting conversion value from filter wheel transmission to expected charge for a theoretical pixel located at the centre of the camera was calculated to be $\average{M}_\lambda = \SI[separate-uncertainty = true]{3253.76 \pm 305.32}{\pe}$\final{check value}.
