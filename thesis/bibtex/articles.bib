	abstract = {The High Altitude Water Cherenkov observatory (HAWC) is an air shower array devised for TeV gamma-ray astronomy. HAWC is located at an altitude of 4100 m a.s.l. in Sierra Negra, Mexico. HAWC consists of 300 Water Cherenkov Detectors, each instrumented with 4 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). HAWC re-uses the Front-End Boards from the Milagro experiment to receive the PMT signals. These boards are used in combination with Time to Digital Converters (TDCs) to record the time and the amount of light in each PMT hit (light flash). A set of VME TDC modules (128 channels each) is operated in a continuous (dead time free) mode. The TDCs are read out via the VME bus by Single-Board Computers (SBCs), which in turn are connected to a gigabit Ethernet network. The complete system produces ≈500 MB/s of raw data. A high-throughput data processing system has been designed and built to enable real-time data analysis. The system relies on off-the-shelf hardware components, an open-source software technology for data transfers (ZeroMQ) and a custom software framework for data analysis (AERIE). Multiple trigger and reconstruction algorithms can be combined and run on blocks of data in a parallel fashion, producing a set of output data streams which can be analyzed in real time with minimal latency ({\textless}5 s). This paper provides an overview of the hardware set-up and an in-depth description of the software design, covering both the TDC data acquisition system and the real-time data processing system.

abstract = {The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is a new observatory for very high-energy (VHE) gamma rays. CTA has ambitions science goals, for which it is necessary to achieve full-sky coverage, to improve the sensitivity by about an order of magnitude, to span about four decades of energy, from a few tens of GeV to above 100 TeV with enhanced angular and energy resolutions over existing VHE gamma-ray observatories. An international collaboration has formed with more than 1000 members from 27 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and North and South America. In 2010 the CTA Consortium completed a Design Study and started a three-year Preparatory Phase which leads to production readiness of CTA in 2014. In this paper we introduce the science goals and the concept of CTA, and provide an overview of the project. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {TARGET 5 is a new application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) of the TARGET family, designed for the readout of signals from photosensors in the cameras of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) for ground-based gamma-ray astronomy. TARGET 5 combines sampling and digitization on 16 signal channels with the formation of trigger signals based on the analog sum of groups of four channels. We describe the ASIC architecture and performance. TARGET 5 improves over the performance of the first-generation TARGET ASIC, achieving: tunable sampling frequency from {\textless}0.4 GSa/s to {\textgreater}1 GSa/s; a dynamic range on the data path of 1.2 V with effective dynamic range of 11 bits and DC noise of ∼0.6 mV; 3-dB bandwidth of 500 MHz; crosstalk between adjacent channels {\textless}1.3{\%}; charge resolution improving from 40{\%} to {\textless}4{\%} between 3 photoelectrons (p.e.) and {\textgreater}100 p.e. (assuming 4 mV per p.e.); and minimum stable trigger threshold of 20 mV (5 p.e.) with trigger noise of 5 mV (1.2 p.e.), which is mostly limited by interference between trigger and sampling operations. TARGET 5 is the first ASIC of the TARGET family used in an IACT prototype, providing one development path for readout electronics in the forthcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).},

abstract = {Until April 2007 the Major Atmospheric Gamma ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescope used a 300 MSamples/s flash analog-to-digital converter (FADC) system to sample the shaped photomultiplier tube (PMT) signals produced by the captured Cherenkov photons of air showers. Different algorithms to reconstruct the signal from the read-out samples (extractors) have been implemented and are described and compared. Criteria based on the obtained charge and time resolution/bias are defined and used to judge the different extractors, by applying them to calibration, cosmic and pedestal signals. The achievable charge and time resolution have been derived as functions of the number of incident photo-electrons. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The GCT is an innovative dual-mirror solution proposed for the small-size telescopes for CTA, capable of imaging primary cosmic gamma-rays from below a TeV to hundreds of TeV. The reduced plate scale resulting from the secondary optics allows the use of compact photosensors, including multi-anode photomultiplier tubes or silicon photomultipliers. We show preliminary results of Monte Carlo simulations using the packages CORSIKA and Sim{\_}telarray, comparing the relative performance of each photosensor type. We also investigate the effect of the secondary optics in terms of optical performance, image resolution and camera response. With the ongoing commissioning of the prototype structure and camera, we present the preliminary expected performance of GCT.},

	abstract = {(Abridged) The Large Area Telescope (Fermi/LAT, hereafter LAT), the primary instrument on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi) mission, is an imaging, wide field-of-view, high-energy gamma-ray telescope, covering the energy range from below 20 MeV to more than 300 GeV. This paper describes the LAT, its pre-flight expected performance, and summarizes the key science objectives that will be addressed. On-orbit performance will be presented in detail in a subsequent paper. The LAT is a pair-conversion telescope with a precision tracker and calorimeter, each consisting of a 4x4 array of 16 modules, a segmented anticoincidence detector that covers the tracker array, and a programmable trigger and data acquisition system. Each tracker module has a vertical stack of 18 x,y tracking planes, including two layers (x and y) of single-sided silicon strip detectors and high-Z converter material (tungsten) per tray. Every calorimeter module has 96 CsI(Tl) crystals, arranged in an 8 layer hodoscopic configuration with a total depth of 8.6 radiation lengths. The aspect ratio of the tracker (height/width) is 0.4 allowing a large field-of-view (2.4 sr). Data obtained with the LAT are intended to (i) permit rapid notification of high-energy gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and transients and facilitate monitoring of variable sources, (ii) yield an extensive catalog of several thousand high-energy sources obtained from an all-sky survey, (iii) measure spectra from 20 MeV to more than 50 GeV for several hundred sources, (iv) localize point sources to 0.3 - 2 arc minutes, (v) map and obtain spectra of extended sources such as SNRs, molecular clouds, and nearby galaxies, (vi) measure the diffuse isotropic gamma-ray background up to TeV energies, and (vii) explore the discovery space for dark matter.},

abstract = {The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) is a system of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) located in the Khomas Highland in Namibia. It measures cosmic gamma rays of very high energies (VHE; {\textgreater}100 GeV) using the Earth's atmosphere as a calorimeter. The H.E.S.S. Array entered Phase II in September 2012 with the inauguration of a fifth telescope that is larger and more complex than the other four. This paper will give an overview of the current H.E.S.S. central data acquisition (DAQ) system with particular emphasis on the upgrades made to integrate the fifth telescope into the array. At first, the various requirements for the central DAQ are discussed then the general design principles employed to fulfil these requirements are described. Finally, the performance, stability and reliability of the H.E.S.S. central DAQ are presented. One of the major accomplishments is that less than 0.8{\%} of observation time has been lost due to central DAQ problems since 2009. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The next-generation very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray observatory, the Cherenkov Telescope Array, will feature dozens of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), each with thousands of pixels of photo-sensors. To be affordable and reliable, reading out such an array of up to a million channels requires event recording technology that is highly integrated and modular, with a low cost per channel. We present the design and performance of a chip targeted to this application: the TeV Array Readout with GSa/s sampling and Event Trigger (TARGET). This application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) has 16 parallel input channels, a 4096-sample buffer for each channel, adjustable input termination, self-trigger functionality, and tight window-selected readout. We report the performance of the first-generation version of this chip (TARGET 1) in terms of sampling frequency, power consumption, dynamic range, current-mode gain, analog bandwidth, and cross talk. The large number of channels per chip allows a low cost per channel ({\$}10 to {\$}20 including front-end and back-end electronics but not including photosensors) to be achieved with a TARGET-based IACT readout system. In addition to basic performance parameters of the TARGET 1 chip, we present a camera module prototype as well as a second-generation chip (TARGET 2), both of which have now been produced.{\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Ground based Cherenkov telescope systems measure astrophysical gamma-ray emission against a background of cosmic-ray induced air showers. The subtraction of this background is a major challenge for the extraction of spectra and morphology of gamma-ray sources. The unprecedented sensitivity of the new generation of ground based very-high-energy gamma-ray experiments such as H.E.S.S. has lead to the discovery of many previously unknown extended sources. The analysis of such sources requires a range of different background modelling techniques. Here we describe some of the techniques that have been applied to data from the H.E.S.S. instrument and compare their performance. Each background model is introduced and discussed in terms of suitability for image generation or spectral analysis and possible caveats are mentioned. We show that there is not a single multi-purpose model, different models are appropriate for different tasks. To keep systematic uncertainties under control it is important to apply several models to the same data set and compare the results.},

abstract = {The Cherenkov Telescopes Array (CTA) is planned as the future instrument for very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray astronomy with a wide energy range of four orders of magnitude and an improvement in sensitivity compared to current instruments of about an order of magnitude. Monte Carlo simulations are a crucial tool in the design of CTA. The ultimate goal of these simulations is tofind the most cost-effective solution for given physics goals and thus sensitivity goals or to find, for a given cost, the solution best suited for different types of targets with CTA. Apart from uncertain component cost estimates, the main problem in this procedure is the dependence on a huge number of configuration parameters, both in specifications of individual telescope types and in the array layout. This is addressed by simulation of a huge array intended as a superset of many different realistic array layouts, and also by simulation of array subsets for different telescope parameters. Different analysis methods-inuse with current installations andextended (or developed specifically) for CTA -are applied to the simulated data sets for deriving the expected sensitivity of CTA. In this paper we describe the current status of this iterative approach to optimize the CTA design and layout. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) have resulted in a break-through in very-high energy (VHE) gamma-ray astrophysics. While early IACT installations faced the problem of detecting any sources at all, current instruments are able to see many sources, often over more than two orders of magnitude in energy. As instruments and analysis methods have matured, the requirements for calibration and modelling of physical and instrumental effects have increased. In this article, a set of Monte Carlo simulation tools is described that attempts to include all relevant effects for IACTs in great detail but aims to achieve this in an efficient and flexible way. These tools were originally developed for the HEGRA IACT system and later adapted for the H.E.S.S. experiment. Their inherent flexibility to describe quite arbitrary IACT systems makes them also an ideal tool for evaluating the potential of future installations.

abstract = {The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is planned to be the next generation ground based observatory for very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray astronomy. Gamma-rays provide a powerful insight into the non-thermal universe and hopefully a unique probe for new physics. Imaging Cherenkov telescopes have already discovered more than 170 VHE gamma-ray emitters providing plentiful of valuable data and clearly demonstrating the power of this technique. In spite of the impressive results there are indications that the known sources represent only the tip of the iceberg. A major step in sensitivity is needed to increase the number of detected sources, observe short time-scale variability and improve morphological studies of extended sources. An extended energy coverage is advisable to observe far-away extragalactic objects and improve spectral analysis. CTA aims to increase the sensitivity by an order of magnitude compared to current facilities, to extend the accessible gamma-ray energies from a few tens of GeV to a hundred of TeV, and to improve on other parameters like angular and energy resolution. CTA will provide moreover a full sky-coverage by featuring an array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes in both hemispheres. This paper presents an overview of the technical design and summarize the current status of the project. CTA prospects for some key science topics like the origin of relativistic cosmic particles, the acceleration mechanisms in extreme environments such as neutron stars and black holes and searches for Dark Matter are discussed.},

Physics data-taking with FACT started in October 2011, a few hours after installation of the camera. Since Summer 2012, FACT is operated remotely without the need of a data-taking crew on site. During more than three years of operation of FACT, G-APDs have proven to be very reliable. Despite operating them regularly also under very strong moonlight conditions, the GAPDs show no change in their properties or any indication for aging. This allows FACT to have a successful monitoring program of the brightest TeV blazars in the Northern hemisphere and several flare-alerts have been sent to the community.

The camera of this novel optical design has a small plate scale which enables the use of compact photosensors. We present an extensive and detailed study of the two most promising devices being considered for this telescope design: the silicon photomultiplier and the multi-anode photomultiplier tube.

The VERITAS data acquisition system consists of a 500 Mega-Sample-Per-Second custom-built flash ADC system, which samples the Cherenkov light pulse every 2 nanoseconds. The integrated charge in each flash ADC channel is proportional to the amount of Cherenkov light incident on the corresponding photomultiplier tube. Accurate reconstruction of the integrated charge is required for accurate energy estimation and spectral reconstruction. A reliable calculation of the integrated charge at low intensities can lead to a reduction in the energy threshold of the system, and an increase in sensitivity. This paper investigates and compares several approaches for evaluating the integrated charge. The Cherenkov pulse timing information in the flash ADC readout has the potential to assist in background rejection techniques. Various methods for extracting the timing information are investigated and excellent timing resolution is achieved.},

abstract = {This thesis concerns a study to determine new methods of analysing data taken with VERITAS, a new array of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, and the application of these methods to astrophysical observations of blazars during the array-commissioning phase. The VERITAS array uses a data acquisition system which employs custom-built hardware to record the tem-poral development of the extensive air shower which occurs when a very high-energy gamma ray strikes the atmosphere. A suite of analysis tools are developed, investigated and optimised in order to determine the most suitable mechanism for analysing these data. Following this study, the new analysis tools are applied to observations of the Crab Nebula, a steady source of TeV gamma rays in the northern hemisphere. The Crab Nebula data are used to optimise and calibrate the analysis. This analysis is applied to very high-energy observations of the blazars 1ES 0647+250, 1ES 0806+524 and 1ES 2344+514. Although no emission is detected from any of these objects, constraining upper limits on the integral flux above 0.3 TeV are derived. The upper limit on TeV emission above 0.3 TeV from 1ES 0806+525 is less than that predicted by one of the emission models studied. Concurrent x-ray ob-servations of the three blazars with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer are used to find enhanced x-ray emission during one of the VERITAS exposures on 1ES 0647+250.},

abstract = {During the past decade, significant advances have been made in TeV 0954-3899/23/9/004/img2-ray astronomy arising mainly from development of the imaging atmospheric Cerenkov technique (IACT). This topical review summarizes instrumental and analytical advances which have made possible the rejection of the background hadronic showers with an efficiency close to 100{\%}, while simultaneously rejecting no more than 50{\%} of genuine 0954-3899/23/9/004/img2-ray showers. Application of large optical reflectors to the detection and registration of shower images is described, together with image formation and mapping of Cerenkov photons using high-resolution imaging focal plane detectors. An overview is presented of how images are processed and parametrized, prior to 0954-3899/23/9/004/img2/hadron separation. In the context of rejection strategies, the deleterious muon background is also discussed. The gradual evolution of a number of dedicated 0954-3899/23/9/004/img2/hadron separation strategies is summarized from the standpoint of both single and multiple telescope operation. The review concludes with an overview of astrophysical accomplishments to date, based on successful application of proven 0954-3899/23/9/004/img2/hadron separation strategies. Potential future trends are discussed.},

abstract = {? 2017 Author(s).The future ground-based gamma-ray observatory Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will feature multiple types of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, each with thousands of pixels. To be affiordable, camera concepts for these telescopes have to feature low cost per channel and at the same time meet the requirements for CTA in order to achieve the desired scientific goals. We present the concept of the TeV Array Readout Electronics with GSa/s sampling and Event Trigger (TARGET) Application Specific Circuit (ASIC), envisaged to be used in the cameras of various CTA telescopes, e.g. the Gamma-ray Cherenkov Telescope (GCT), a proposed 2-Mirror Small-Sized Telescope, and the Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (SCT), a proposed Medium-Sized Telescope. In the latest version of this readout concept the sampling and trigger parts are split into dedicated ASICs, TARGET C and T5TEA, both providing 16 parallel input channels. TARGET C features a tunable sampling rate (usually 1 GSa/s), a 16k sample deep buffier for each channel and on-demand digitization and transmission of waveforms with typical spans of ?100 ns. The trigger ASIC, T5TEA, provides 4 low voltage diffierential signal (LVDS) trigger outputs and can generate a pedestal voltage independently for each channel. Trigger signals are generated by T5TEA based on the analog sum of the input in four independent groups of four adjacent channels and compared to a threshold set by the user. Thus, T5TEA generates four LVDS trigger outputs, as well as 16 pedestal voltages fed to TARGET C independently for each channel. We show preliminary results of the characterization and testing of TARGET C and T5TEA.},

@book{johnson2005design,
abstract = {Design Patterns is a modern classic in the literature of object-oriented development, offering timeless and elegant solutions to common problems in software design. It describes patterns for managing object creation, composing objects into larger structures, and coordinating control flow between objects. The book provides numerous examples where using composition rather than inheritance can improve the reusability and flexibility of code. Note, though, that it's not a tutorial but a catalog that you can use to find an object-oriented design pattern that's appropriate for the needs of your particular application--a selection for virtuoso programmers who appreciate (or require) consistent, well-engineered object-oriented designs. Now on {\{}CD{\}}, this internationally acclaimed bestseller is more valuable than ever! Use the contents of the {\{}CD{\}} to create your own design documents and reusable components. The {\{}CD{\}} contains: 23 patterns you can cut and paste into your own design documents; sample code demonstrating pattern implementation; complete Design Patterns content in standard {\{}HTML{\}} format, with numerous hyperlinked cross-references; accessed through a standard web browser; Java-based dynamic search mechanism, enhancing online seach capabilities; graphical user environment, allowing ease of navigation. First published in 1995, this landmark work on object-oriented software design presents a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to common design problems. Created by four experienced designers, the 23 patterns contained herein have become an essential resource for anyone developing reusable object-oriented software. In response to reader demand, the complete text and pattern catalog are now available on {\{}CD{\}}-{\{}ROM{\}}. This electronic version of Design Patterns enables programmers to install the book directly onto a computer or network for use as an online reference for creating reusable object-oriented software. The authors first describe what patterns are and how they can help you in the design process. They then systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. All patterns are compiled from real-world examples and include code that demonstrates how they may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages such as C++ and Smalltalk. Readers who already own the book will want the {\{}CD{\}} to take advantage of its dynamic search mechanism and ready-to-install patterns.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 SPIE.The Central Calibration Facilities workpackage of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatory for very high energy gamma ray astronomy defines the overall calibration strategy of the array, develops dedicated hardware and software for the overall array calibration and coordinates the calibration efforts of the different telescopes. The latter include LED-based light pulsers, and various methods and instruments to achieve a calibration of the overall optical throughput. On the array level, methods for the inter-telescope calibration and the absolute calibration of the entire observatory are being developed. Additionally, the atmosphere above the telescopes, used as a calorimeter, will be monitored constantly with state-of-the-art instruments to obtain a full molecular and aerosol profile up to the stratosphere. The aim is to provide a maximal uncertainty of 10{\%} on the reconstructed energy-scale, obtained through various independent methods. Different types of LIDAR in combination with all-sky-cameras will provide the observatory with an online, intelligent scheduling system, which, if the sky is partially covered by clouds, gives preference to sources observable under good atmospheric conditions. Wide-field optical telescopes and Raman Lidars will provide online information about the height-resolved atmospheric extinction, throughout the field-of-view of the cameras, allowing for the correction of the reconstructed energy of each gamma-ray event. The aim is to maximize the duty cycle of the observatory, in terms of usable data, while reducing the dead time introduced by calibration activities to an absolute minimum.},

abstract = {The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) represents the most advanced facility designed for Cherenkov Astronomy. ASTRI SST-2M has been developed as a demonstrator for the Small Size Telescope in the context of the upcoming CTA. Its main innovation consists in the optical layout which implements the Schwarzschild-Couder configuration and is fully validated for the first time. The ASTRI SST-2M optical system represents the first qualified example for two mirrors telescope for Cherenkov Astronomy. This configuration permits to (i) maintain a high optical quality across a large FoV (ii) de-magnify the plate scale, (iii) exploit new technological solutions for focal plane sensors. The goal of the paper is to present the optical qualification of the ASTRI SST-2M telescope. The qualification has been obtained measuring the PSF sizes generated in the focal plane at various distance from the optical axis. These values have been compared with the performances expected by design. After an introduction on the Gamma Astronomy from the ground, the optical design and how it has been implemented for ASTRI SST-2M is discussed. Moreover the description of the setup used to qualify the telescope over the full field of view is shown. We report the results of the first--light optical qualification. The required specification of a flat PSF of {\$}\backslashsim 10{\$} arcmin in a large field of view {\~{}}10 deg has been demonstrated. These results validate the design specifications, opening a new scenario for Cherenkov Gamma ray Astronomy and, in particular, for the detection of high energy (5 - 300 TeV) gamma rays and wide-field observations with CTA.},

abstract = {CORSIKA is a program for detailed simulation of extensive air showers initiated by high energy cosmic ray particles. Protons, light nuclei up to iron, photons, and many other particles may be treated as primaries. The particles are tracked through the atmosphere until they undergo reactions with the air nuclei or - in the case of instable secondaries - decay. The hadronic interactions at high energies may be described by five reaction models alternatively: The VENUS, QGSJET, and DPMJET models are based on the Gribov-Regge theory, while SIBYLL is a minijet model. HDPM is a phenomenological generator and adjusted to experimental data wherever possible. Hadronic interactions at lower energies are described either by the more sophisticated GHEISHA interaction routines or the rather simple ISOBAR model. In particle decays all decay branches down to the 1{\%} level are taken into account. For electromagnetic interactions the shower program EGS4 or the analytical NKG formulas may be used. Options for the generation of Cherenkov radiation and neutrinos exist.},

abstract = {The single-mirror small-size telescope (SST-1M) is one of the three proposed designs for the small-size telescopes (SSTs) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) project. The SST-1M will be equipped with a 4 m-diameter segmented mirror dish and an innovative fully digital camera based on silicon photo-multipliers (SiPMs). Since the SST sub-array will consist of up to 70 telescopes, the challenge is not only to build a telescope with excellent performance, but also to design it so that its components can be commissioned, assembled and tested by industry. In this paper we review the basic steps that led to the design concepts for the SST-1M camera and the ongoing realization of the first prototype, with focus on the innovative solutions adopted for the photodetector plane and the readout and trigger parts of the camera. In addition, we report on results of laboratory measurements on real scale elements that validate the camera design and show that it is capable of matching the CTA requirements of operating up to high-moon-light background conditions.},

abstract = {ASTRI SST-2M is one of the prototypes of the small size class of telescopes proposed for the Cherenkov Telescope Array. Its optical design is based on a dual-mirror Schwarzschild-Couder configuration, and the camera is composed by a matrix of monolithic multipixel silicon photomultipliers managed by ad-hoc tailored front-end electronics. This paper describes the procedures for the gain calibration on the ASTRI SST-2M. Since the SiPM gain depends on the operative voltage and the temperature, we adjust the operative voltages for all sensors to have equal gains at a reference temperature. We then correct gain variations caused by temperature changes by adjusting the operating voltage of each sensor. For that purpose the SiPM gain dependence on operating voltage and on temperature have been measured. In addition, we present the calibration procedures and the results of the experimental measurements to evaluate, for each pixel, the parameters necessary to make the trigger uniform over the whole focal plane.},

abstract = {The field of gamma-ray astronomy has seen important progress during the last decade, yet there exists so far no common software framework for the scientific analysis of gamma-ray telescope data. We propose to fill this gap by means of the GammaLib software, a generic library that we have developed to support the analysis of gamma-ray event data. GammaLib has been written in C++ and all functionality is available in Python through an extension module. On top of this framework we have developed the ctools software package, a suite of software tools that enables building of flexible workflows for the analysis of Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope event data. The ctools are inspired by science analysis software available for existing high-energy astronomy instruments, and they follow the modular ftools model developed by the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center. The ctools have been written in Python and C++, and can be either used from the command line, via shell scripts, or directly from Python. In this paper we present the GammaLib and ctools software versions 1.0 that have been released end of 2015. GammaLib and ctools are ready for the science analysis of Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope event data, and also support the analysis of Fermi-LAT data and the exploitation of the COMPTEL legacy data archive. We propose to use ctools as the Science Tools software for the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory.},

Since October 2011, it is regularly taking data on the Canary Island of La Palma. G-APDs are ideal detectors for Cherenkov telescopes as they are robust and stable. Furthermore, the insensitivity of G-APDs towards strong ambient light allows to conduct observations during bright Moon and twilight. This gain in observation time is essential for the long-term monitoring of bright TeV blazars. During the commissioning phase, hundreds of hours of data (including data from the the Crab Nebula) were taken in order to understand the performance and sensitivity of the instrument. The data cover a wide range of observation conditions including different weather conditions, different zenith angles and different light conditions (ranging from dark night to direct full Moon).We use a new parmetrisation of the Moon light background to enhance our scheduling and to monitor the atmosphere.With the data from 1.5 years, the long-term stability and the performance of the camera during Moon light is studied and compared to that achieved with photomultiplier tubes so far.

Data from the Whipple Observatory's 10 m gamma-ray telescope is utilized to test selection methods based on source location. The results compare these selection methods with traditional techniques and three different camera fields of view.

abstract = {The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will be the largest ground-based observatory operating in the very-high-energy gamma-ray (20 GeV - 300 TeV) range. It will be based on more than one hundred telescopes, located at two sites (northern and southern hemispheres). The energy coverage, in the southern CTA array, will extend up to hundreds of TeV thanks to 70 small size telescopes (SST), with primary mirrors of about 4 meters in diameter and large field of view of the order of 9 degrees. It is proposed that one of the first sets of precursors for the CTA SSTs array will be represented by nine ASTRI telescopes. Their prototype, named ASTRI SST-2M, is installed in Italy. It is currently completing the overall commissioning before entering the science verification phase that will performed observing bright TeV sources as Crab Nebula, Mrk421 and Mrk 501 cross-checking the prototype performance with the Monte Carlo predictions. ASTRI telescopes are characterized by a dual-mirror optical design based on the Schwarzschild- Couder (SC) configuration. The focal-plane camera is curved in order to fit the ideal prescription for the SC design and the sensors are small size silicon photomultipliers read-out by a fast front-end electronics. The telescope prototype installed in Italy, has been developed by the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics, INAF, following an end-to-end approach that comprises all aspects from the design, construction and implementation of the entire hardware and software system to the final scientific products. All parts of the system have been designed to comply with the CTA requirements. A collaborative effort, addressed to the implementation of the first ASTRI telescopes for the CTA southern site, is now on-going led by INAF with the Universidade de Sao Paulo (Brazil), the North-West University (South Africa) and the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics.},

abstract = {The present work aims to address a comprehensive analytical analysis of a new accurate equivalent electrical model of silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) detectors. The proposed circuit model allows to truthfully reproduce the output signal waveform generated by the light sensors apart from the specific technology adopted for the fabrication process, and can also be profitably exploited to perform reliable circuit-level simulations. A detailed and in-depth investigation of the functional parameters involved in the output pulse signals is here developed, and the most significant physical relationships are analytically derived as well. Experimental measurements are finally carried out on real devices, in order to validate the accuracy of the attained expressions, and good fittings are achieved between the analytical curve plots and the associated measurements results. The adopted analysis turns out to be particularly helpful when designing an optimum front-end architecture for SiPM detectors, since the performance of the entire detection system, especially in terms of dynamic range and timing resolution, can be accurately predicted as a function of the SiPM model parameters and the foremost features of the coupled front-end electronics. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {We present a high-performance event reconstruction algorithm: an Image Pixel-wise fit for Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (ImPACT). The reconstruction algorithm is based around the likelihood fitting of camera pixel amplitudes to an expected image template. A maximum likelihood fit is performed to find the best-fit shower parameters. A related reconstruction algorithm has already been shown to provide significant improvements over traditional reconstruction for both the CAT and H.E.S.S. experiments. We demonstrate a significant improvement to the template generation step of the procedure, by the use of a full Monte Carlo air shower simulation in combination with a ray-tracing optics simulation to more accurately model the expected camera images. This reconstruction step is combined with an MVA-based background rejection. Examples are shown of the performance of the ImPACT analysis on both simulated and measured (from a strong VHE source) gamma-ray data from the H.E.S.S. array, demonstrating an improvement in sensitivity of more than a factor two in observation time over traditional image moments-fitting methods, with comparable performance to previous likelihood fitting analyses. ImPACT is a particularly promising approach for future large arrays such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) due to its improved high-energy performance and suitability for arrays of mixed telescope types. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Rech2008,
abstract = {One of the main issues of Single Photon Avalanche Diode arrays is optical crosstalk. Since its intensity increases with reducing the distance between devices, this phenomenon limits the density of integration within arrays. In the past optical crosstalk was ascribed essentially to the light propagating from one detector to another through direct optical paths. Accordingly, reflecting trenches between devices were proposed to prevent it, but they proved to be not completely effective. In this paper we will present experimental evidence that a significant contribution to optical crosstalk comes from light reflected internally off the bottom of the chip, thus being impossible to eliminate it completely by means of trenches. We will also propose an optical model to predict the dependence of crosstalk on the distance between devices.},

abstract = {The steady TeV gamma-ray emission from the Crab Nebula has been used to optimize the sensitivity of the Whipple Observatory atmospheric Cerenkov imaging telescope. Using this method, which is of order 20 times more sensitive than the standard method using a simple non-imaging detector, it is possible to detect the Crab Nebula at a significance level in excess of 6 standard deviations (6 sigma) in under 1 hr on source (with a corresponding time observing a background comparison region); a source one-tenth the strength of the Crab Nebula can be detected at the 4 sigma level after 40 hr on the source (and 40 hr on a background region). A variety of sources have been monitored using this technique over the period 1988-1991, but none were detected apart from the Crab Nebula. Upper limits are presented which in many instances are a factor of 10 below the flux of the Crab Nebula. These upper limits assume steady emission from the source and cannot rule out sporadic gamma-ray emission with short duty cycles.},

abstract = {The Gamma-ray Cherenkov Telescope (GCT) is a small-sized telescope (SST) that represents one of three novel designs that are based on Schwarzschild-Couder optics and are proposed for use within the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). The GAmma-ray Telescope Elements (GATE) program has led an effort to build a prototype of the GCT at the Paris Observatory in Meudon, France. The mechanical structure of the prototype, known as the SST-GATE prototype telescope, is now complete along with the successful installation of the camera. We present the results of extensive simulation work to determine the optical performance of the SST-GATE prototype telescope. Using the ROBAST software and assuming an ideal optical system, we find the radius of the encircled point spread function ($\theta$80) of the SST-GATE to be ∼1.3 arcmin (∼0.02°) for an on-axis ($\theta$field=0°) observation and ∼3.6 arcmin (∼0.06°) for an observation at the edge of the field of view ($\theta$field=4.4°). In addition, this research highlights the shadowing that results from the stopping of light rays by various telescope components such as the support masts and trusses. It is shown that for on-axis observations the effective collection area decreases by approximately 1 m2as a result of shadowing components other than the secondary mirror. This is a similar loss (∼11{\%}) to that seen with the current generation of conventional Davies-Cotton (DC) Cherenkov telescopes. An extensive random tolerance analysis was also performed and it was found that certain parameters, especially the secondary mirror z-position and the tip and tilt rotations of the mirrors, are critical in order to contain $\theta$80within the pixel limit radius for all field angles. In addition, we have studied the impact upon the optical performance of introducing a hole in the center of the secondary mirror for use with pointing and alignment instruments. We find that a small circular area (radius {\textless} 150 mm) at the center of the secondary mirror can be used for instrumentation without any significant impact upon optical performance. Finally, we studied the impact of reducing the size of the primary mirror for the prototype telescope and found that this comes at the cost of poorer image quality and light collection efficiency for all field angles, but at a significant cost saving for a one-off prototype.},

The SiPM features low-voltage operation, insensitivity to magnetic fields, mechanical robustness and excellent uniformity of response. Due to these traits, the SensL SiPM has rapidly gained a proven performance in the fields of medical imaging, hazard and threat detection, biophotonics, high energy physics and LiDAR.

abstract = {Ground based gamma-ray observations with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) play a significant role in the discovery of very high energy (E {\textgreater} 100 GeV) gamma-ray emitters. The analysis of IACT data demands a highly efficient background rejection technique, as well as methods to accurately determine the energy of the recorded gamma-ray and the position of its source in the sky. We present results for background rejection and signal direction reconstruction from first studies of a novel data analysis scheme for IACT measurements. The new analysis is based on a set of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied to images from the four H.E.S.S. phase-I telescopes. As the H.E.S.S. cameras pixels are arranged in a hexagonal array, we demonstrate two ways to use such image data to train CNNs: by resampling the images to a square grid and by applying modified convolution kernels that conserve the hexagonal grid properties. The networks were trained on sets of Monte-Carlo simulated events and tested on both simulations and measured data from the H.E.S.S. array. A comparison between the CNN analysis to current state-of-the-art algorithms reveals a clear improvement in background rejection performance. When applied to H.E.S.S. observation data, the CNN direction reconstruction performs at a similar level as traditional methods. These results serve as a proof-of-concept for the application of CNNs to the analysis of events recorded by IACTs.},

abstract = {Light falling on a photodetector produces an output current that fluctuates. The noise in this signal arises from two sources: randomness in the photon arrivals and randomness in the carrier multiplication process intrinsic to the photodetector. A general formula is derived for the variance of the photodetector output current in terms of parameters characterizing these two sources of randomness (the photon-number variance-to-mean ratio for the light and the excess noise factor for the detector). An important special case of this formula illustrates that the output-current variance is directly proportional to the detector excess noise factor when the number of photons at the input to the detector is Poisson distributed. Explicit expressions for excess noise factors are provided for three kinds of photodetectors: the double-carrier conventional avalanche photodiode, the double-carrier superlattice avalanche photodiode, and the photomultiplier tube. The results for the double-carrier superlattice device are new; it is shown that even a small amount of residual hole ionization can lead to a large excess noise factor. Comparisons are drawn among the detectors in terms of their noise properties.},

abstract = {Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM), also called Solid State Photomultipliers (SSPM), are based on Geiger mode avalanche breakdown that is limited by a strong negative feedback. An SSPM can detect and resolve single photons due to the high gain and ultra-low excess noise of avalanche multiplication in this mode. Crosstalk and afterpulsing processes associated with the high gain introduce specific excess noise and deteriorate the photon number resolution of the SSPM. The probabilistic features of these processes are widely studied because of its significance for the SSPM design, characterization, optimization and application, but the process modeling is mostly based on Monte Carlo simulations and numerical methods. In this study, crosstalk is considered to be a branching Poisson process, and analytical models of probability distribution and excess noise factor (ENF) of SSPM signals based on the Borel distribution as an advance on the geometric distribution models are presented and discussed. The models are found to be in a good agreement with the experimental probability distributions for dark counts and a few photon spectrums in a wide range of fired pixels number as well as with observed super-linear behavior of crosstalk ENF. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Gamma-ray Cherenkov Telescope (GCT) is a candidate for the Small Size Telescopes (SSTs) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). Its purpose is to extend the sensitivity of CTA to gamma-ray energies reaching 300 TeV. Its dual-mirror optical design and curved focal plane enables the use of a compact camera of 0.4 m diameter, while achieving a field of view of above 8 degrees. Through the use of the digitising TARGET ASICs, the Cherenkov flash is sampled once per nanosecond continuously and then digitised when triggering conditions are met within the analogue outputs of the photosensors. Entire waveforms (typically covering 96 ns) for all 2048 pixels are then stored for analysis, allowing for a broad spectrum of investigations to be performed on the data. Two prototypes of the GCT camera are under development, with differing photosensors: Multi-Anode Photomultipliers (MAPMs) and Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). During November 2015, the GCT MAPM (GCT-M) prototype camera was integrated onto the GCT structure at the Observatoire de Paris-Meudon, where it observed the first Cherenkov light detected by a prototype instrument for CTA.},

abstract = {The Compact High Energy Camera (CHEC) is a camera design for the Small-Sized Telescopes (SSTs; 4 m diameter mirror) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). The SSTs are focused on very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray detection via atmospheric Cherenkov light detection over a very large area. This implies many individual units and hence cost-effective implementation, as well as shower detection at large impact distance, and hence large field of view (FoV), and efficient image capture in the presence of large time gradients in the shower image detected by the camera. CHEC relies on dual-mirror optics to reduce the plate-scale and make use of 6 × 6 mm2pixels, leading to a low-cost (∼150 k€), compact (0.5 m × 0.5 m), and light (∼45 kg) camera with 2048 pixels providing a camera FoV of ∼9 degrees. The CHEC electronics are based on custom TARGET (TeV array readout with GSa/s sampling and event trigger) application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) sampling incoming signals at a gigasample per second, with flexible camera-level triggering within a single backplane FPGA. CHEC is designed to observe in the $\gamma$-ray energy range of 1–300 TeV, and at impact distances up to ∼500 m. To accommodate this and provide full flexibility for later data analysis, full waveforms with 96 samples for all 2048 pixels can be read out at rates up to ∼900 Hz. The first prototype, CHEC-M, based on multi-anode photomultipliers (MAPMs) as photosensors, was commissioned and characterised in the laboratory and during two measurement campaigns on a telescope structure at the Paris Observatory in Meudon. In this paper, the results and conclusions from the laboratory and on-site testing of CHEC-M are presented. They have provided essential input on the system design and on operational and data analysis procedures for a camera of this type. A second full-camera prototype based on Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), addressing the drawbacks of CHEC-M identified during the first prototype phase, has already been built and is currently being commissioned and tested in the laboratory.},
