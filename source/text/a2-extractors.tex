	\section{Plan}
	\subsection{Topics}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item RMS extracted charge with varying integration window size and shift with different NSBs and amplitudes (and combination of amplitudes)
		\item Charge resolution of different methods with different NSB (including full integration method)
		\item in the absence of the need for peak finding (laser illumination), and when peak finding is important (Cherenkov) - split into two, best integration technique (different NSBs, different integration window sizes), and best peak finding (different NSBs, need Cherenkov data)
		\item window size might actually change for Cherenkov - got to capture entire signal, and signal might not be centred at "calculated peak time".
	\end{itemize}
